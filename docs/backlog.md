# A list of high-level concepts which would be cool to have

* System of game scenes (e.g. Roster, DungeonMenu, Dungeon, Skirmish)
* Save system
* Graveyard
* "Lone Adventurer" mode
* Map/Adventure
  * create classes for Map: Room, Corridor
  * create classes for random events in a corridor and a room: bag, bookshelf, trap, enemies
* A bunch of other scale parameters in addition to HP: stress, mana, stamina/fatigue
* Create a specification for the different stages of what features the game consists of.
